# Stock-ML (Analysis-Only)

**Purpose:** Daily, automated pipeline to **collect** NSE EOD prices & public news, **build features**, **train** a nextâ€‘day return model, **predict**, and **evaluate** with gap explanations. No trading or broker APIs.

## Quick start
1. **Python 3.10+** recommended
2. Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. First run (one-time or to backfill today):
   ```bash
   python pipeline/build_universe.py
   python pipeline/collect_prices_nse.py
   python pipeline/collect_news.py
   python pipeline/build_features.py
   python pipeline/train_model.py
   python pipeline/predict.py
   python pipeline/evaluate_and_explain.py
   ```
4. **API**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.serve:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   # GET /predict_today, /explain_gap, /accuracy_by_stock?window=60
   ```
5. **Scheduler (IST timings)**:
   ```bash
   python pipeline/scheduler.py
   ```

### Notes
- This is **analysis-only**. No buy/sell, no broker APIs.
- Uses **NSE bhavcopy** (EOD zip CSV). If a day's bhavcopy isn't published yet, it falls back to the previous trading day.
- News are pulled from configurable public RSS feeds and sentiment-scored with VADER. You can later swap in FinBERT or paid APIs.
- Make sure outbound internet access is allowed on the host/container for downloads.

This repository is for **educational analysis** only. It is **not investment advice**.
